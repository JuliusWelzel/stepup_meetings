### Day 3 (Saturday, 24th of feburary)
The third day will be all about social sports activities. From 10:30-12:00 we will play the first StepuP basketball tournament at [Sportcentrum Uilenstede](https://sportcentrumvu.nl/en/).
After lunch, there will be an opportunity to join a typical Dutch sports activity as well: ice skating! For this we will meet at the [Jaap Eden baan](https://www.jaapeden.nl/).

## Location
The meeting will be held at the [VU](http://www.vu.nl/en/index.aspx) in Amsterdam.

## Transportation
If you are familiar with using a bike, the best way to get around in Amsterdam is by bike. Renting a bike is therefore recommended (Stay safe though! Cycling in Amsterdam can be quite challenging due to crowded traffic).
Alternatively the use of the public transport (trams, buses) is recommended. You can check in and out (don't forget to check out) with your bank card.

## Accomodation
If you want to stay in Amsterdam, we recommend these two accomodations:
-   [Amsterdam South hotel](https://www.citizenm.com/hotels/europe/amsterdam/amsterdam-south-hotel) (close to the VU)
-   [Hotel Jansen Schinkel](https://hoteljansen.nl/) (cheaper, more student like)

## Organizers

The meeting is organized by [Moira](mailto:a.m.van.leeuwen@vu.nl?subject=StepuP%20meeting) and [Julius](mailto:j.welzel@neurologie.uni-kiel.de?subject=StepuP%20meeting)
